Drum-Solo Pants
===============

Drum-Solo Pants is a project built during Science Hack Day Dublin, 2014. During 
the course of the 36 hour hackathon, we developed the Arduino and Raspberry Pi 
code which communicate using a Ciseco RF Arduino shield and Ciseco SRF USB 
stick (which is a pleasure to work with, on Arduino, RPi and Linux).
